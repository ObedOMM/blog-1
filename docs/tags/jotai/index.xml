      <description>Introduction Recently, I often got asked about this question: Which is recommended, valtio or jotai?
For those who are not familiar with them, they are two out of many state management libraries that I developed.
https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio
https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai
Now, from the library perspective, their implementations are very different. However, from the usage perspective, I understand the confusion. Both serve similar functionalities and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually use both in a single app.</description>

      <description>Introduction I stumbled upon 7GUIS tasks while reading XState Tutorials. This motivated me to challenge those 7 tasks with jotai.
It turned out that this would be a good resource to learn jotai. They are from basic tasks to advanced tasked, and you will see how they are implemented, occasionally magically.
It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to try it yourself first. If you succeed to implement it, then you can compare. Even if you fail, you can read and learn.</description>
